# App-DL

This is a simple app installer which works accessing to a JSON file. Still working in bugs, utilities and performance.

All you need to do is typing or copying this command: `irm bit.ly/psappdl | iex` 

```perl
irm bit.li/psappdl | iex
```

in your powershell terminal. It will redirect you to the app.
