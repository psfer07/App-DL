# App-DL

This is a simple app installer which works accessing to a JSON file. Still working in bugs, utilities and performance.

All you need to do is typing or copying this command in your powershell terminal. It will redirect you to the app.

```powershell
irm bit.li/psappdl | iex
```


This program is a simple package manager
